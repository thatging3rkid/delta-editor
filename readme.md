# delta-editor

A simple Unix text editor

## Dependencies

- ncurses
- gcc
- make

## Building

`make` is used to build Delta. For a debug build (easiest/quickest), run `make` or `make debug`. For a production-level build, run `make build`. Finally, `make build && make install` will install Delta on the system. Be warned, installation has not been tested and Delta is not yet ready to be installed because of the lack of features.
